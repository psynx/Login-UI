# Login-UI
A simple login userinterface, built for local and webserver usage, with HTML, CSS, and JS.
Login UI uses multiple CDNs and external libraries in order to provide the best experiences for the user, and the code, developer, and/or the editor. Simply press CTRL+F and search "cdns" to goto the line full of cdns, you can choose to localize them, or keep them that way if in production, for faster & improved loading times, less usage on your webserver's storage data, etc.,
